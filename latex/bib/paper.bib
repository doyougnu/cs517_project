abstract="A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains. Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

abstract = { 'Satisfiability (SAT) related topics have attracted researchers
                  from various disciplines: logic, applied areas such as
                  planning, scheduling, operations research and combinatorial
                  optimization, but also theoretical issues on the theme of
                  complexity and much more, they all are connected through SAT.
                  My personal interest in SAT stems from actual solving: The
                  increase in power of modern SAT solvers over the past 15 years
                  has been phenomenal. It has become the key enabling technology
                  in automated verification of both computer hardware and
                  software. Bounded Model Checking (BMC) of computer hardware is
                  now probably the most widely used model checking technique.
                  The counterexamples that it finds are just satisfying
                  instances of a Boolean formula obtained by unwinding to some
                  fixed depth a sequential circuit and its specification in
                  linear temporal logic. Extending model checking to software
                  verification is a much more difficult problem on the frontier
                  of current research. One promising approach for languages like
                  C with finite word-length integers is to use the same idea as
                  in BMC but with a decision procedure for the theory of
                  bit-vectors instead of SAT. All decision procedures for
                  bit-vectors that I am familiar with ultimately make use of a
                  fast SAT solver to handle complex formulas. Decision
                  procedures for more complicated theories, like linear real and
                  integer arithmetic, are also used in program verification.
                  Most of them use powerful SAT solvers in an essential way.
                  Clearly, efficient SAT solving is a key technology for 21st
                  century computer science. I expect this collection of papers
                  on all theoretical and practical aspects of SAT solving will
                  be extremely useful to both students and researchers and will
                  lead to many further advances in the field.' Edmund Clarke
