\label{section:background}

In this section, we provide background on the minimum feedback arc set problem,
incremental \ac{sat} and \ac{smt} solving, and unsatisfiable cores. We begin
with preliminaries on graphs and feedback arc sets. We close the section with a
description of incremental \ac{sat} solving and \ac{smt} solving.

On a directed graph \graph{G}{V}{E} a \emph{feedback arc set} \fas{S} is a set
of edges in $\kf{E}$, such that removing them from the graph $\kf{G}$ results in
an acyclic graph. The minimum feedback arc set problem finds the
\optimal{\fas{S}} of the minimum size. For weighted graphs, one might desire
\optimal{\fas{S}} to have the minimum total weight of any \fas{S}. Finding this
\optimal{\fas{S}} is the minimum weighted feedback arc set problem.
