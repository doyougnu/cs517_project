\label{section:background}

In this section, we provide background on the minimum feedback arc set problem,
incremental \ac{sat} and \ac{smt} solving, and unsatisfiable cores. We begin
with preliminaries on graphs and feedback arc sets.

On a directed graph \graph{G}{V}{E} a \emph{feedback arc set} \fas{S} is a set
of edges in $\kf{E}$, such that removing them from the graph $\kf{G}$ results in
an acyclic graph. The minimum feedback arc set problem finds the
\optimal{\fas{S}} of the minimum size. For weighted graphs, one might desire
\optimal{\fas{S}} to have the minimum total weight of any \fas{S}. Finding this
\optimal{\fas{S}} is the minimum weighted feedback arc set problem.

\NOTE{Hi Mike! This is a special note environment just for you. From this point
  we plan on giving an overview of the necessary interface for sat and smt
  solving. We're planning on adapting this from Jeff's PhD thesis, so it won't
  be from whole cloth.}
